# Expressing Numbers

## Binary Numbers:

Binary numbers start with 0b for example `ob11011`

## Octal Numbers:

Octal numbers start with 0 for example `017777`

## Hex Numbers:

Hex Numbers start with 0x for example `0x133a4`

## Binary to Hex conversion:

There are eight hex digits in a hexit. So that means that each bit will be equivalent to one hex value.

A byte (8 bits) is just 2 hexadecimal digits (2^8 = 16)

Ex: `0x6a 0x55 0x0e 0xa3 => 0x6a550ea3`

## Operations on hex numbers:

 - Addresses are in hex.
 - You can add/values directly in hex ( 0x1345 + 0x10 = 0x1355)
 - You can use additions with two's complement to avoid subtracting

## Big Endian

The first byte is the most significant one

## Little Endian

The last byte is the most significant one
